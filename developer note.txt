YOU BETTER READ THIS OR I WILL FIND YOU >:(

Working Zibbie on the run has been a real pain for me. I spent hundreds of hours working on this. I've let 
down family and friends just so I could finish this god forsaken game. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. 
So I just want to say, thank you for taking the time to play zibbie, and even if you didn't play it, thank you
for giving up your time reading this. <333
